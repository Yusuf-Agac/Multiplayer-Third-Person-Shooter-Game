I made the project to improve myself in unreal engine and multiplayer game development. It was a very useful project for my personal development. I learned basic mechanics such as server client relationship, replications, sessions and optimization techniques in multiplayer games. It was my first unreal engine experience, it helped me understand the structure of the engine and the C++ language, now I feel more comfortable using the engine.
